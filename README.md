# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of JavaScript mini-projects! üöÄ

I was always into Data Science and Machine Learning but recently I have dived into Web Development. I made a lot of machine learning models but couldn't display them as proper projects. To complete those and make them end-to-end, I started with HTML and CSS, with Python and Django or Flask (depending on my mood) for the backend.

However, with this new year, I decided to take a slight break and properly give Web Development a go. So, in this journey, I dedicated myself to learning JavaScript and gave it my best shot. 

Getting tired of just learning it, I made these projects for fun, and now I'm excited to showcase them here.
