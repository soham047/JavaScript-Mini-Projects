# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of JavaScript mini-projects! üöÄ
--------------------------------------------------------

I have always been passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning, but recently, I ventured into the world of Web Development. 
While I built numerous machine learning models, I often struggled to present them as complete, polished projects. To bridge that gap, I began exploring HTML and CSS, pairing them with Python frameworks like Django or Flask, depending on my creative whims.

With the new year, I decided to take a step back from my usual pursuits and fully immerse myself in Web Development. This journey led me to focus on mastering JavaScript, giving it my all.

Instead of just learning the boring way, I channeled my skills into creating these fun, interactive projects. Now, I‚Äôm thrilled to share them and showcase my progress in this exciting domain.
